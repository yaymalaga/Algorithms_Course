# Algorithms assigments

These are my assigments' solutions for the Algorithms course from Princeton University.

In order to run these algorithms, the file [algs4.jar](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar) must be downloaded and added to the classpath. Furthermore, as no package is used in the solutions, the generated .class must be also added to the classpath.
